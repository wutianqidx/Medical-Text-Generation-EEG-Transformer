CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 16, admitted with recurrent tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lamictal
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is described as very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The drowsy state includes generous beta and low-voltage theta.  Vertex waves appear, as do spindles.  Brief stimulation of the patient produces a brief alerting with theta but sustained wakefulness was not identified.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of sleep and did not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in a drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The excessive drowsiness may be due to this patient's medications or sleep deprivation.  She has eye movements into sleep which is not a pathological finding and can be seen in normal as well as well as those with sleep disturbances and depression. Prior EEGs demonstrated parietal spikes.

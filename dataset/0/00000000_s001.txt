MEDICINES:  Singular, Aldactone, Lasix, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.25 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow roving eye movements and attenuation of the alpha and rhythmic central theta.  Stage 2 sleep was not sustained.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of value.
